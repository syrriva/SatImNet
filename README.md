# SatImNet
An open collection of training sets for satellite image classification and segmentation tasks

* A pre-print of a publication that describes the methodology behind the data sets structure and demonstrates a data fusion based satellite image classification can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10623;â€‹
* The native location of **SatImNet** collection is in the *EOS* storage system of the **Big Data Analytics Platform** (/eos/jeodpp/data/base/MachineLearning);
* The data are also provided via FTP: https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/public/MachineLearning/SatImNet/
* This repository contains the Python scripts (in the form of Jupyter notebooks) to access and query the **SatImNet** collection via FTP;
* Any feedback is very much welcome.

## Python 3 packages
The Jupyter notebooks have been tested with two Docker images having the following Python requirements:
